# Sage: GPT-4 Voice Assistant with Speech Recognition

Welcome to Sage, our GPT-4 Voice Assistant with Speech Recognition repository! This project aims to create a voice assistant utilizing GPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation, coupled with speech recognition capabilities, all implemented in Python.

## Overview

Sage integrates GPT-4, a powerful natural language processing model, with a speech recognition library. By combining these technologies, the assistant can understand voice commands, process natural language queries, and generate contextual responses in a conversational manner.

## Features

- **GPT-4 Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Speech Recognition**: Incorporates a Python speech recognition library for converting speech to text.
- **Conversational Interface**: Provides a conversational interface where users can interact with the voice assistant.
